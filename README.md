# Cache-Replacement
A simulation of FIFO, LRU and Optimal Cache Replacement Policies

A visual simulation of these policies + hit/miss ratio calculations for every new entry.

Assumptions:
1) Input values range: 0-9 (both inclusive)
2) No. of inputs: 10
(to be made dynamic later)

TODO:
1) Dynamic number of blocks
2) Dynamic number of entries
3) Clean up UI
4) Switching between policies mid-way
