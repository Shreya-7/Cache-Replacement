A visual, real-time simulation of these policies + hit/miss ratio calculations for every new entry.

TODO:  
- Can check_for_present be replaced by in?
- For optimal, store all positions beforehand, no calculations needed
- Add fifo to optimal
- Stop spillovers
- Maintain queue for optimal
- Store block number in the queue
- Switching policies midway
- STYLING
